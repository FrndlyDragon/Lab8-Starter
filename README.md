## How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
With service workers, you can still load images despite there being no internet. This follows along the lines of graceful degradation as it means that some functionalities were still retained despite the removal of crucial parts of the functionality like internet access. Thus, service workers are a tool that can be used in order to achieve graceful degradation.
